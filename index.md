## Wayne County, Michigan Repeater Crawl

The Wayne County Repeater Crawl takes place in Wayne County, Michigan and neighboring areas. We are a very informal group of amateur radio operators who like to meet up and talk. 
The purpose of our gathering is to communicate using many of the repeaters available to us in Wayne County, MI and surrounding areas. By doing this, we can meet new people, try 
out repeaters we may not have used before, and get a better idea of the capabilities of our stations. All licensed amateur radio operators are welcome to participate.

### Schedule and Format

The Crawl takes place on Friday evenings beginning at 7:00 PM EDT, sometimes a few minutes before.

KD8ZSK, Keith, usually fills the role of Net Control Station (NCS). Format is pretty informal, but all participants are asked to follow the NCS's instructions to ensure
smooth operations and a pleasant experience for all.

### Frequencies

The list of repeaters (and simplex frequencies) tends to change every week. This website should always have the current list.
